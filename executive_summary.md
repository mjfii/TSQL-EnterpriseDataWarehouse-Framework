##Executive Summary##

In the current information architecture, there is not a comprehensive and reliable source of information for analytics and reporting.  As a result, significant effort is required each time a business question is asked.  Questions that should takes minutes, or even seconds, to answer, end up taking weeks, or even months, for analysts to research, reply, and react.  This latency inhibits decision making abilities and ultimately generates a significant and unwarranted cost.

In order to address this issue, the client has partnered with Slalom Consulting to design, develop, and deploy an enterprise class Information Management Framework.  The solution will be spilt into four (4) primary layers:

1. **The Storage Layer**: Manages complete storage of relevant information in a non-redundant, organized, and secure format.
2. **The Transformational Layer**:  Delivers processes and methodologies for moving information ‘to and from’ various sources and destinations.
3. **The Analytical Layer**:  Provides logical information layer that is attuned with asking and answering business questions. 
4. **The Visualization Layer**:  Allows for surfacing of information and insight to be depicted in a variety of formats, i.e., geospatial heat maps, interactive dashboards, multidimensional graphing, dynamic grids, standard reports, etc.

The architecture outlined in this document will address the ‘Storage Layer’ and the ‘Transformational Layer’ (or ETL), collectively defined as the Enterprise Data Warehouse (“EDW”).  Other documents will address the remaining layers.
It is important to understand that it is not meant to be an end-all-be-all solution; it is designed as an platform for continued change and growth to address new business needs, to expand content with other departments, and to realign quickly to changes in corporate strategy and tactics.  Additionally, the solution will act as an enabler for corporate data governance, stewardship, and ownership of enterprise related information.

With the above stated in mind, this project will focus on the initial content aligned with the needs of the `CRM team`, i.e. customer related analytics.  These new components will support a holistic view of the customer and their interactions with the products and services Vail Resorts’ provides.

Slalom has taken great care to adhere to best practices and to develop a solution that can easily be managed after the project has been completed.  This will promote user acceptance and provide a far greater return on investment.
